ECE 4724 - Embedded Systems Dissection Project
----------------------------------------------
This repository is part of a class project for embedded systems during my undergrad at Mississippi State University. I was tasked with taking apart and reverse engineering an embedded system.
The device I chose was an Expert Grill handheld thermometer. 

Over the course of the project:
- I took apart the device
- Compiled a bill of materials of the electronic components within
- Created flow diagrams for the workflow of the device
- Created usage timing diagrams for each use case using an oscilloscope
- Found the extreme values of operation for the device (i.e. voltage)
- Resoldered the parts back to the board and reassembled the device to assure it still worked

After the completion of the dissection, I created the website in this repository to house all of my findings.
The project really opened up my eyes to the possibilities of the world of Embedded Systems and what they're capable of doing.
